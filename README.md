## Video Compression
### Audio Encoding
* FFmpeg AAC encoding require number of samples each frame be exactly 1024 (frame->nb_samples = 1024), otherwise, it will return "more samples than frame size" for avcodec_encode_audio2 function (error code -22, Invalid Argument).
* When creating AVFrame with PCM buffer using avcodec_fill_audio_frame, be sure to read the document clearly:
    > The buffer buf must be a preallocated buffer with a size big enough to contain the specified samples amount. The filled AVFrame data pointers will point to this buffer.

    So buf pointer needs to be pre-allocated and will be assigned to AVFrame. Therefore, don't try to reuse the pointer for other things, which will cause electronic noise after the AVFrame done processing (dirty buffer).

### Hardware Acceleration

* nVidia Jetson Hardware Acceleration Options (for Jetson Nano, Jetson Xavior). NV SDK ffnvcodec is not available. You can only get hardware acceleration with nvmpi through: <a href="https://github.com/jocover/jetson-ffmpeg">Jetson-FFMpeg</a>, (which by default works with FFmpeg 4.2, for other versions of FFmpeg, you need to apply patch manually). For other platforms, FFmpeg can support hardware acceleration directly through nvsdk.
